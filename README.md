# Rice_Genes_Prediction
Data of the Paper

The data of PPI download from three databases: 
PRIN(http://bis.zju.edu.cn/prin/).
RicePPINet(http://netbio.sjtu.edu.cn).
STRING(https://cn.string-db.org).

Co_expression constructed by RNA-seq obtained from ncbi.

The drought genes obtained from China Rice Data Center.



The Code to deal with these data:
deal data.R     #deal with the PPI data
Test_Code.R     #deal with intersection of two network
R packages_Test.R  #LOOCV  and predict potential genes
